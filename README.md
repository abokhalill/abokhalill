distributed systems

currently building **chronon (chr2)** — a consensus engine that enforces crash-safe side effects.

---

### Work
- **[chr2](https://github.com/abokhalill/chr2)**  
  Solving the dual-write problem from first principles.  
  Side effects are part of the protocol, not an afterthought.

- **Nullpoint** *(upcoming)*  
  An invariant-centric kernel.  
  State as durable facts, not mutable variables.

---

### Principles
- Crash safety is non-negotiable.
- “Exactly once” is a claim, not a property.

Lamport was right.
